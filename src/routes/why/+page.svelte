			ELRS is an amazing project. Its high performance and low cost make it a great choice for many applications.
			<br><br>
			That has however made it attractive for many kinds of misuse, be it for illegal, unsafe or unethical 
			purposes. Users and even manufacturers seek to gain an advantage or even profit by using ELRS in ways 
			that are not condoned, supported, or aided by the community and the development team.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			This is a very real issue that I wanted to shine the light to... in the silliest way that I could come 
			up with.
			<br><br>
			Every time a question related to "incorrect" use of ELRS in the ELRS Discord server comes up and 
			gets reported, the timer resets. Job safety accident prevention style.
			<br><br>
			Please don't take this seriously.

			If you're reading this as the site was linked in response to your question in the ELRS Discord server,
			please don't take it personally. It's not the first or last time that a question like this has come up, 
			but the answer is always the same. While we sympathize with your situation in the terrible conflict, the 
			developers and support team do not wish to provide any assistance or support for war/illegal efforts.
			<br><br>
			Providing support to get frequencies out of the legal range can get the project in legal trouble with 
			other countries' regulations. Some of this information may be available publicly in other places by 
			third parties, but we cannot provide it here.
			<br><br>
			There is also the possibility of that info going to the wrong hands, the responsibility of which is taken 
			pretty seriously. You may be able to find official, private channels for this kind of information, but definitely not 
			in the public community.
