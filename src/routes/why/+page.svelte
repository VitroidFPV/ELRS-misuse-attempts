		<p>
			ELRS is an amazing project. Its high performance and low cost make it a great choice for many applications.
			<br><br>
			That has however made it attractive for many kinds of misuse, be it for illegal, unsafe or unethical 
			purposes. Users and even manufacturers seek to gain an advantage or even profit by using ELRS in ways 
			that are not condoned, supported, or aided by the community and the development team.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			This is a very real issue that I wanted to shine the light to... in the silliest way that I could come 
			up with.
			<br><br>
			Every time a question related to "incorrect" use of ELRS in the ELRS Discord server comes up and 
			gets reported, the timer resets. Job safety accident prevention style.
			<br><br>
			Please don't take this seriously.
